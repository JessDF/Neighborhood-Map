# Neighborhood-Map
Udacity Fullstack Web Development Nanodegree Program - Project 7: Neighborhood Map
<br>Site hosted on: https://jdowding-neighborhood-map.herokuapp.com/ 
### Project Description
- You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. 
- You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: 
    - Map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, 
    - A search function to easily discover these locations, 
    - A listview to support simple browsing of all locations. 
- You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations 
    - Such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc.

### Running Locally
- Download or clone from https://github.com/JessDF/Neighborhood-Map
- Once you do so, you will want to run the index.html file
    - You can do this by double-clicking the file. 
    - The path in the browser should be something like: <br> 
        <a style="padding: 20px;" href="file:///C:/Users/Jessie/Desktop/Neighborhood-Map/index.html">file:///C:/Users/Jessie/Desktop/Neighborhood-Map/index.html</a>

### How to Use
- When you first view the site, it will show an empty map on the left
- On the right, there are a few features you may test out:
    - "Options": When clicked, will hide/show the options box/features 
    - "Show Places": Will show all 5 locations on the map
        - You can click on the location and it will show street view and location name
    - "Hide Places": Will hide all markers on the map
    - "Locations": Shows all the places you can search for, are in our "Show Places
        - You can click on the different buttons, will zoom into location
        - Click on location and see wikipedia articles on the location
    - "Search Bar": Type in a location, or part of a location from list and will zoom in.
        - Will zoom into the first location on list
        - Click on location and see wikipedia articles on the location

### Note -
- I used some of the code given to use throughout the course
- Within the folder "sideactivities": All the projects I did following along with the videos
- Was having trouble adding data to my list, looked at https://github.com/eheslouis/neighborhood and https://github.com/tralpha/neighborhood for ideas on how they did it. Did similar HTML styling of the two for list output.
