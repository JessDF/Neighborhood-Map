# Neighborhood-Map
Udacity Fullstack Web Development Nanodegree Program - Project 7: Neighborhood Map

### Project Description
- You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. 
- You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: 
    - Map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, 
    - A search function to easily discover these locations, 
    - A listview to support simple browsing of all locations. 
- You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations 
    - Such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc.

### How to
- When you first view the site, it will show an empty map on the left
- On the right, there are a few features you may test out:
    - "Show Places": Will show all 5 locations on the map
        - You can click on the location and it will show street view and location name
    - "Hide Places": Will hide all markers on the map
    - "Locations": Shows all the places you can search for, are in our "Show Places"
    - "Search Bar": Type in a location, or part of a location from list and will zoom in.
        - Will also show a special marker
        - You can click on the location and it will list hours of location, address, and an image
